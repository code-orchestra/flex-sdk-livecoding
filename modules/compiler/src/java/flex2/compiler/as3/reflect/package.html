<BODY>

This package contains the TypeTable, implementations of the AbcClass,
Attributes, MetaData, Method, Namespace, and Variable from the
flex2.compiler.abc package.

This package also includes NodeMagic, which was originally intended to
capture all calls into ASC, other than the ones made by
flex2.compiler.as3.As3Compiler, with the intent that they could be
collected into an official API in the future. Due to increased
integration, this effort was dropped.
